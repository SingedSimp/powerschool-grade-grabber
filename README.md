This will need adjusting, with the following parts:  
The numbers of the `form` array at the end need to be changed depending on if you have tardies or absences (currently configure for absences and no tardies in all classes).  
The login script will need adjusting depending on your school system or district's login system.  
You may want to change delays, currently configured for slow school wi-fi.
